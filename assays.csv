Blood is drawn into a test tube containing liquid citrate, which acts as an anticoagulant by binding the calcium in a sample. The blood is mixed, then centrifuged to separate blood cells from plasma. In newborns, whole blood is used. The plasma is analyzed by a biomedical scientist on an automated instrument at 37 degrees C, which takes a sample of the plasma. An excess of calcium is added (thereby reversing the effects of citrate), which enables the blood to clot again. For an accurate measurement the proportion of blood to citrate needs to be fixed; many laboratories will not perform the assay if the tube is underfilled and contains a relatively high concentration of citrate. If the tube is underfilled or overfilled with blood, the standardized dilution of 1 part anticoagulant to 9 parts whole blood is no longer valid. For the prothrombin time test the appropriate sample is the blue top tube, or sodium citrate tube, which is a liquid anticoagulant. Tissue factor (also known as factor III or thromboplastin) is added, and the time the sample takes to clot is measured optically. Some laboratories use a mechanical measurement, which eliminates interferences from lipemic and icteric samples.

The principle inhibitor of Thrombin, Factor Xa and other coagulation serine proteases in plasma is Antithrombin III. The rate of inhibition, under normal conditions, is slow, but can be increased several thousand-fold by Heparin. This mechanism accounts for the anticoagulant effect of Heparin. Low Molecular Weight Therapeutic Heparin (LMWH) preparations appear to catalyze the reaction between Factor Xa and Antithrombin III more readily than the reaction between Thrombin and Antithrombin III while standard Heparin catalyzes both reactions equally. The Factor Xa inhibition test is the most useful test for assaying the widest variety of therapeutic Heparin preparations. In this method, when both Factor Xa and Antithrombin III are present in excess, the rate of Factor Xa inhibition is directly proportional to the Heparin concentration.
