+ label: cap analysis of gene expression
- label: cap analysis of gene expression 
  alternative term: CAGE
  definition: An assay which aims at monitoring RNA transcript abundances in biological samples by extracting 5' ends of capped transcripts, RTPCR and sequence those. Copy numbers of CAGE tags provide  a way of quantification and provide a measure of expression of the transcriptome 
  definition source: PMID:14663149
  example of usage: 5' end-centered expression profiling using cap-analysis gene expression and next-generation sequencing.
