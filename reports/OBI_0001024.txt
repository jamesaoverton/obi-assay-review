  label: RNASE U2 structure mapping assay
  alternative term: single nucleotide resolution mapping assay using RNAse U2
  definition: a single-nucleotide-resolution ribonucleic acid structure mapping assay which uses RNAase U2 as reagent and enzymatic probe to generate data and information at nucleotide resolution scale contributing to the determination of nucleic acid secondary structure
