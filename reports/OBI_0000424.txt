  label: transcription profiling assay
  alternative term: gene expression profiling
  ISA alternative term: transcription profiling
  definition: An assay which aims to provide information about gene expression and transcription activity using ribonucleic acids collected from a material entity using a range of techniques and instrument such as DNA sequencers, DNA microarrays, Northern Blot
  definition source: OBI
  example of usage: Whole genome transcription profiling of Anaplasma phagocytophilum in human and tick host cells by tiling array analysis. BMC Genomics. 2008 Jul 31;9:364. PMID: 18671858
