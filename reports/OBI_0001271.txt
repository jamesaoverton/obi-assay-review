  label: RNA-seq assay
  alternative term: transcription profiling by high throughput sequencing
  definition: An assay in which sequencing technology (e.g. Solexa/454) is used to generate RNA sequence, analyse the transcibed regions of the genome, and or to quantitate transcript abundance
  definition source: EFO_0002770 transcription profiling by high throughput sequencing
  curator note: JZ: should be inferred as 'DNA sequencing'. Will check in the future.
  curator note: an assay that uses high-throughput sequencing technologies to sequence cDNA in order to get information about a sample's RNA content. RNA-Seq provides researchers with efficient ways to measure transcriptome data experimentally, allowing them to get information such as how different alleles of a gene are expressed, detect post-transcriptional mutations or identify gene fusions.
