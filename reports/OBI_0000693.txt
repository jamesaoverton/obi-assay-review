  label: MeDIP-seq assay
  alternative term: Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing assay
  definition: is an assay which aims at identifying methylated sites in genomic DNA and determining methylation pattern that affect  gene transcription by relying on immunoprecipitation of methylated genomic DNA, creation of a library of corresponding DNA fragments (either single or paired-end fragments) and subsequent sequencing using parallelized sequencing methods.
