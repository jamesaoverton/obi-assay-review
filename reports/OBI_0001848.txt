  label: chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing
  alternative term: ChIA-PET
  alternative term: ChIA-PET assay
  definition: An assay that incorporates chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-based enrichment, chromatin proximity ligation, Paired-End Tags, and high-throughput sequencing to determine de novo long-range chromatin interactions genome-wide.
