+ label: electrophoretic mobility shift assay
- label: electrophoretic mobility shift assay 
  alternative term: EMSA,gel shift assay, gel mobility shift assay, band shift assay, gel retardation assay
  definition: is an assay which aims to provide information about Protein-DNA or Protein-RNA interaction and which used gel electrophoresis and relies on the fact the molecular interactions will cause the heterodimer to be retarded on the gel when compared to controls corresponding to protein extract alone and protein extract + neutral nucleic acid.
  definition source: PMID:6269071
  example of usage: Electrophoretic mobility shift assay reveals a novel recognition sequence for Setaria italica NAC protein.
