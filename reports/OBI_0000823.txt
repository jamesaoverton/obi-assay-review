  label: thrombin time assay
  definition: A  thrombin time assay is on in which after liberating the plasma from whole blood by centrifugation, bovine Thrombin is added to the sample of plasma. The clot is formed and is detected optically or mechanically by a coagulation instrument. The time between the addition of the thrombin and the clot formation is recorded as the thrombin clotting time

  example of usage: PMID:19696660#The thrombin time was determined using thromboclotin assay kit.
  editor note: 2009/10/18 Alan Ruttenberg. This assay was added during the fucoidan use case exercise but still needs to be fleshed out. Only the AT-III assay has more carefully specified inputs and outputs
