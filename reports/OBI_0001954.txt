  label: ChIP assay
  alternative term: chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
  definition: An assay in which protein-DNA complexes are extracted from short regions of chromatin and are reversibly cross linked, immunoprecipitated with antibodies or tags, purified, and amplified with the aim of analysis gene- and promoter-specific known targets
  definition source: adapted from CHS protocols, wikipedia, life tech, ChIP-seq term definition
  example of usage: PMID: 6379641
