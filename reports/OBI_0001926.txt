  subclass of: 'transcription profiling assay'
+ subclass of: 'transcription profiling assay' and (has_specified_output some ('measured expression level' and ('is about' some miRNA)))'
+ subclass of: (has_specified_input some 'ribonucleic acid') and (realizes some ('evaluant role' and ('inheres in' some 'ribonucleic acid')))
+ subclass of: has_specified_output some 'measured expression level'
+ subclass of: has_specified_output some miRNA
- equivalent to: 'transcription profiling assay' and (has_specified_output some 
      ('measured expression level' and ('is about' some miRNA)))
- subclass of: realizes some 
          ('evaluant role'
           and ('role of' some 'ribonucleic acid'))
