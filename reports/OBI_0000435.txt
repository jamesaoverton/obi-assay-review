label: genotyping assay
alternative term: genotype profiling, SNP genotyping
definition: an assay which generates data about a genotype from a specimen of genomic DNA. A variety of  
techniques and instruments can be used to produce information about sequence variation at particular genomic positions.

DIFFERENT LOGIC

BEFORE
equivalent to: has_specified_output some 'genotype information'
subclass of: achieves_planned_objective some 'sequence feature identification objective'
subclass of: assay
subclass of: has_specified_input some 
      (specimen
       and ('has part' some 'deoxyribonucleic acid'))
subclass of: has_specified_output some 'genotype information'
subclass of: realizes some 
      ('analyte role'
       and ('role of' some 'deoxyribonucleic acid'))

AFTER
subclass of: (has_specified_input some 'deoxyribonucleic acid') and (realizes some ('analyte role' and ('inheres in' some 'deoxyribonucleic acid')))
subclass of: 'analyte assay'
subclass of: has_specified_input some 'specimen and ('has part' some deoxyribonucleic acid)'
subclass of: has_specified_output some 'genotype information'
