  label: antithrombin-III (AT-III) berichrome assay
  definition: An antithrombin-III (AT-III) assay in which exogenous bovine thrombin and heparin are added to test plasma to form a thrombin-heparin-AT complex. The residual thrombin not bound then hydrolyzes the p-nitroalanine substrate to produce a yellow color, which is read at 405 nm. The intensity of color produced is inversely proportional to the AT present. A calibration is done with standard human plasma reagent and results for a given specimen are reported as a percentage relative to the standard
