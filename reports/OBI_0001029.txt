  label: OH-radical structure mapping assay
  alternative term: MOHCA assay
  alternative term: OH footprinting assay
  alternative term: single nucleotide resolution mapping assay using OH-radical probe
  definition: a single-nucleotide-resolution nucleic acid structure mapping assay which uses hydroxyl radical as reagent and chemical probe to generate data and information at nucleotide resolution scale contributing to the determination of nucleic acid secondary structure
