  label: viral hemagglutination inhibition assay
  definition: An assay that measures the ability of an evaluant to inhibit hemagglutination by a virus. Hemagglutinin is a viral protein which binds to sialic acid receptors on cells or to erythrocytes, causing the cells to clump. Loss of clumping indicates hemagglutination inhibition by the antibody.
  definition source: Bjoern and Melanie
  example of usage: Examining the ability of a monoclonal antibody to inhibit hemagglutination by Influenza A virus by comparing the levels of hemagglutination with and without the presence of the antibody.
