  label: protein-protein interaction detection
  definition: An assay with the objective to determine interactions between proteins, such as protein-protein binding.
  editor note: 20091101, Bjoern Peters: This class may be overly broad. Lot's of assays would seem to classify under it, and I have the feeling that the intend would be to limit this to determining protein-protein interactions as they occur within an organism, rather than e.g. peptide:MHC binding assays.

  subclass of: assay
