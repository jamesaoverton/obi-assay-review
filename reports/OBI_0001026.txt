  label: NMIA RNA structure mapping assay
  alternative term: SHAPE mapping assay
  alternative term: single nucleotide resolution mapping assay using NMIA probe
  definition: a single-nucleotide-resolution ribonucleic acid structure mapping assay which uses NMIA as reagent and chemical probe to generate data and information at nucleotide resolution scale contributing to the determination of nucleic acid secondary structure
