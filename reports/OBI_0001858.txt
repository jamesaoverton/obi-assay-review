  label: cross-linking immunoprecipitation high-throughput sequencing assay
  alternative term: CLIP-seq
  alternative term: CLIP-seq assay
  alternative term: HITS-CLIP
  definition: An assay that employs UV-crosslinking between RNA and the protein, followed by immunoprecipitation with antibodies for the protein, fragmentation, and high-throughput used for screening for RNA sequences that interact with a particular RNA-binding protein.
