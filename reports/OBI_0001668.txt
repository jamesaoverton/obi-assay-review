+ label: split-ubiquitin assay
- label: split-ubiquitin assay 
+ definition: is a kind of yeast 2 hybrid system which enables membrane soluble proteins to be screened.  two integral membrane proteins to be studied are fused to two different ubiquitin moieties: a C-terminal ubiquitin moiety (\"Cub\", residues 35äóñ76) and an N-terminal ubiquitin moiety (\"Nub\", residues 1äóñ34). These fused proteins are called the bait and prey, respectively. In addition to being fused to an integral membrane protein, the Cub moiety is also fused to a transcription factor (TF) that can be cleaved off by ubiquitin specific proteases. Upon baitäóñprey interaction, Nub and Cub-moieties assemble, reconstituting the split-ubiquitin. The reconstituted split-ubiquitin molecule is recognized by ubiquitin specific proteases, which cleave off the reporter protein, allowing it to induce the transcription of reporter genes.
