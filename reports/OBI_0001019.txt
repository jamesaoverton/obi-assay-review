  label: RNA ADA I RNA structure mapping assay
  alternative term: single nucleotide resolution mapping assay using RNA adenosine deaminase I
  definition: a single-nucleotide-resolution ribonucleic acid structure mapping assay which uses RNA adenosine deaminase I as reagent and enzymatic probe to generate data and information at nucleotide resolution scale contributing to the determination of nucleic acid secondary structure
