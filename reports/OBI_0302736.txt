  label: comet assay
  alternative term: SCGE assay
  alternative term: single cell gel electrophoresis  assay
  definition: a comet assay is an assay which utilizes gel electrophoresis on cell exposed to a challenge with the objective to assess DNA damage (DNA breakage) by determining the size and shape of DNA migration in cell placed in an electric field in specific conditions.
