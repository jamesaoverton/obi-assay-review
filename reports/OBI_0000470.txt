  label: mass spectrometry assay
  definition: An assay that identifies the amount and type of material entities present in a sample by fragmenting it and measuring the mass-to-charge ratio of the resulting particles.
  definition source: Philippe Rocca-Serra
  example of usage: Identification of a proteins cut out from a 2D gel by cleaving it into peptides using trypsin digestion using electrospray ionizatino to ensure the peptides are charged, and accelerating them with an electro magnetic field in which the flight path is determined by the mass / charge ratio of the peptides. Comparing the mass/charge ratio of peptides in the proteins with databases of protein sequences allows to identify which protein gave rise to the peptides.
