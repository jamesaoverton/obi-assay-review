  label: bisulfite sequencing
  definition: An assay which allows to determine the methylation status of genomic DNA using DNA sequencing techniques preceded by a bisulfite based chemical modification of genomic DNA at CpG island location.
  definition source: adapted from Wikipedia
  example of usage: PMID: 19581485. High definition profiling of mammalian DNA methylation by array capture and single molecule bisulfite sequencing. Hodges E, Smith A, Kendall J, Xuan Z, Ravi K, Rooks M, Zhang M, Ye K, Battacharjee A, Brizuela L, McCombie WR, Wigler M, Hannon GJ, Hicks J.
    Genome Res. 2009 Jul 6.
  editor note: 8/19/09: Chris says that there may used to be a way of doing bisulfite sequencing comparing lengths of restriction fragments, which implies that it is possible to do without DNA sequencing.
