  label: micrococcal nuclease digestion followed by high throughput sequencing assay
  alternative term: MNase-seq
  alternative term: MNase-seq assay
  definition: An assay to identify nucleosome positioning by genome wide sequencing of regions senstative to digestion by micrococal nuclease
  definition source: Johnson et al. Flexibility and constraint in the nucleosome core landscape of Caenorhabditis elegans chromatin. Genome Res. 2006 Dec;16(12):1505-16. [PMID:17038564]
  example of usage: Cui et al.Genome-wide approaches to determining nucleosome occupancy in metazoans using MNase-Seq. Methods Mol Biol. 2012;833:413-9. [PMID:22183607]
  curator note: JZ: should be inferred as 'DNA sequencing'. Will check in the future.
