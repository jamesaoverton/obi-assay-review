  label: CMCT structure mapping assay
  alternative term: single nucleotide resolution mapping assay using CMCT probe
  definition: a single-nucleotide-resolution nucleic acid structure mapping assay which uses CMCT as reagent and chemical probe to generate data and information at nucleotide resolution scale contributing to the determination of nucleic acid secondary structure
