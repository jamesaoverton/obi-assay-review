  label: northern blot analysis
  alternative term: northern blot
  definition: a northern blot analysis is an assay allowing monitoring presence of gene transcripts  by hybridizing labeled RNA or DNA probes against messenger RNAs isolated from tissue or cell cultures, resolved on denaturing agarose gel, transfered by blotting procedure to a nitrocellulose or nylon membrane and immobilized by cross linking or baking to the membrane. Detection of  hybridization signals is carried out by immunofluorescence or radioactivity measurements using photographic films or digital imaging devices such as Phosphor Imager
  example of usage: PMID: 18428227. Analysis of RNA by northern blot hybridization.
