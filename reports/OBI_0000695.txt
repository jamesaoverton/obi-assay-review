  label: chain termination sequencing
  alternative term: Sanger sequencing
  alternative term: dye terminator sequencing
  definition: is a DNA sequencing which rely on the use of dideoxynucleotides used in 4 distinct sequencing reaction on the same DNA sample. The dideoxynucleotides, once incorporated in the complementary DNA strand being synthesized by the DNA polymerase prevent any further chain elongation. The newly generated sequences are resolved on a polyacrylamide gel using electrophoresis and labels (either fluorochrome or radioactivity) are used to determine the nucleotide present at a given position
