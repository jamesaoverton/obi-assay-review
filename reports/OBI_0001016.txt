  label: DNASE 1 structure mapping assay
  alternative term: DNAse footprinting assay
  alternative term: single nucleotide resolution mapping assay using DNAse I
  definition: a single-nucleotide-resolution deoxyribonucleic acid structure mapping assay which uses DNAse 1 as reagent and enzymatic probe to generate data and information at nucleotide resolution scale contributing to the determination of nucleic acid secondary structure
