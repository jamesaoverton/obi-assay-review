+ label: amplification of intermethylated sites (AIMS) assay
- label: amplification of intermethylated sites (AIMS) assay 
  alternative term: AIMS assay,intermethylated site amplification 
+ definition: amplification of intermethylated sites (AIMS) is an assay appropriate for genome-wide estimates of DNA methylation and the discovery of specific methylated sequences. AIMS is based on the differential enzymatic digestion of genomic DNA with methylation-sensitive and methylation-insensitive isoschizomers followed by restrained PCR amplification of methylated sequences.
