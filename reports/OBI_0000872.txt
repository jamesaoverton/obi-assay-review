  label: serum neutralization of viral infectivity assay
  alternative term: influenza neutralization assay
  definition: A quantitative assay where different
    dilutions of serum are mixed with virus and used to infect cells. At
    the lower dilutions, antibodies will block infection, but at higher
    dilutions, there will be too few antibodies to have an effect. The
    simple process of dilution provides a way to compare the virus-
    neutralizing abilities of different sera. The neutralization titer is
    expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution at which virus
    infection is blocked.

  curator note: MC, 20100217: I added influenza neutralization assay as alternative term. This should be tagged with a community specific value, eg "influenza ontology" or else.
