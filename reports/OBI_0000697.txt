  label: Helicos sequencing
  alternative term: true single molecule sequencing
  definition: is a DNA sequencing which allows sequence identification of billions of DNA molecules immobilized to a surface by using DNA polymerase and fluorescently labeled nucleotides added one at a time. The sequencing process does not requires amplification step and is typically able to produce reads of 25 base pair length.
  definition source: adapted from wikipedia
  example of usage: PMID: 18388294. Single-molecule DNA sequencing of a viral genome.
