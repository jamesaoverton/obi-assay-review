  label: Lead structure mapping assay
  alternative term: single nucleotide resolution mapping assay using Lead probe
  definition: a single-nucleotide-resolution nucleic acid structure mapping assay which uses lead as reagent and chemical probe to generate data and information at nucleotide resolution scale contributing to the determination of nucleic acid secondary structure
