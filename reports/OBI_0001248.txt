  label: ChIP-chip assay
  alternative term: ChIP-on-chip assay
  definition: an assay that aims to investigate the interactions between protein and DNA relying on chromatin immunoprecipitation ('ChIP') combined with microarray technology ('chip'). Specially, it allows the identification of protein binding sites on a genome-wide basis.
