  label: RNA protection assay
  alternative term: RPA; RNAse protection assay
  definition: RPA is a technique to assess the presence and estimate abundance of transcript species by first creating an homo or heteroduplex by adding a specific, complementary sequence to the sequence of interest and then exposing the mixture of ribonuclease, which will degrade only single stranded molecules. A detection step will reveal if the sample contained a sequence of interest.

  example of usage: Absolute concentrations of mRNA for type I and type VI collagen in the canine meniscus in normal and ACL-deficient knee joints obtained by RNase protection assay.
