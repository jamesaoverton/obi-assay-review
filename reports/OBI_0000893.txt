  definition: A laboratory technique based on the PCR, which is used to
    amplify and simultaneously quantify a specific DNA
    molecule based on the use of complementary probes/primers. It enables
    both detection and quantification (as absolute number of copies or relative
    amount when normalized to DNA input or additional normalizing genes) of one
    or more specific sequences in a DNA sample.
