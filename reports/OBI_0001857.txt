  label: RNP (ribonuclear particle) immunoprecipitation high- throughput sequencing assay
  alternative term: RIP-seq
  alternative term: RIP-seq assay
  definition: An assay that combines immunoprecipitation of an RNA-binding protein and RNA-seq to identify mRNAs associated with selected RNA binding proteins (RBPs).
