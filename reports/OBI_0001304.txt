  label: RNAi profiling by array assay
  definition: An assay in which double stranded RNA is synthesized with a sequence complementary to a gene(s) of interest and introduced into a cell or organism, where it is recognized as exogenous genetic material and activates the RNAi pathway resulting in knockdown of the transcripts and providing a means to study downstream changes in gene expression.
