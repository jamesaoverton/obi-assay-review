DIFFERENT LOGIC

BEFORE
subclass of: assay
subclass of: realizes some 
      ('analyte role'
       and ('role of' some glucose))
subclass of: realizes some 
      ('evaluant role'
       and ('role of' some 'blood serum specimen'))

AFTER
subclass of: (has_specified_input some 'blood serum specimen') and (realizes some ('evaluant role' and ('inheres in' some 'blood serum specimen')))
subclass of: (has_specified_input some glucose) and (realizes some ('analyte role' and ('inheres in' some glucose)))
subclass of: 'analyte assay'
