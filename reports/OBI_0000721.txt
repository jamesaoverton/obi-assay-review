  label: glucose tolerance test
  definition: is a process in  which following administration of a bolus a glucose in-vivo, glucose clearance from blood plasma is monitored over time by repeated glucose measurement in blood serum. the output of a process is a measure which can be used to evaluate the severity of insulin resistance or the efficiency of glucose clearance.
