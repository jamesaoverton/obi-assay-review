  definition source: PERSON:Bjoern Peters, Randi Vita, Jason Greenbaum
  example of usage: Determination of KD value for an antibody binding a protein using a BIACORE assay. Using plate bound antigen in an ELISA to determine if a mixture of serum antibodies bind the antigen.nnThe following are NOT binding assays, as the desired output is not binding data: RNA microarray experiments to determine levels of gene expression. ChIP experiments to determine where in DNA a transcription factor binds. Using an IL-2 antibody on an ELISA plate to determine presence of IL-2 after stimulating a T cell culture.
