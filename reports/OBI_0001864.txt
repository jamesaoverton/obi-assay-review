  label: RNA Annotation and Mapping of Promoters for the Analysis of Gene Expression assay
  alternative term: RAMPAGE
  definition: An assay that identifies transcription start sites (TSS), the quantification of their expression and the characterization
    of their transcripts using high throughput sequencing.
