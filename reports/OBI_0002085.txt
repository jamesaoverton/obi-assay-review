  label: transcript expression location detection by hybridization chain reaction
  alternative term: transcript expression location detection by fluorescent HCR.
  definition: An in situ hybridization in which the location (e.g. anatomical/tissue) of a transcript is detected by a multiplexed fluorescent in situ hybridization, based on orthogonal amplification with hybridization chain reactions (HCR). RNA probes complementary to mRNA targets trigger chain reactions in which fluorophore-labeled RNA hairpins self-assemble into tethered fluorescent amplification polymers.
  definition source: PMID 21037591
  example of usage: PMID 25977364: "Multiplexed imaging of mRNA expression using fluorescent hybridization chain reaction (HCR) quantitatively confirmed the expression profiles of lead cells"
