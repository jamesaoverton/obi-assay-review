  label: DNA methylation profiling assay
  ISA alternative term: DNA methylation profiling
  definition: an assay which aims to provide information about state of methylation of DNA molecules using genomic DNA collected from a material entity using a range of techniques and instrument such as DNA sequencers and often relying on treatment with bisulfites to ensure cytosine conversion.
  definition source: OBI branch derived
  example of usage: Genome-wide, high-resolution DNA methylation profiling using bisulfite-mediated cytosine conversion.  Reinders J, Delucinge Vivier C, Theiler G, Chollet D, Descombes P, Paszkowski J.
