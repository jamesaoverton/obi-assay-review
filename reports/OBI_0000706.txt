  label: SOLiD sequencing
  definition: is a DNA sequencing which allows sequence identification by relying on the following steps:
    1. Primers hybridize to the P1 adapter sequence within the library template.
    2. A set of four fluorescently labeled di-base probes compete for ligation to the sequencing primer. Specificity of the di-base probe is achieved by interrogating every 1st and 2nd base in each ligation reaction.
    3. Multiple cycles of ligation, detection and cleavage are performed with the number of cycles determining the eventual read length.
    4. Following a series of ligation cycles, the extension product is removed and the template is reset with a primer complementary to the n-1 position for a second round of ligation cycles
