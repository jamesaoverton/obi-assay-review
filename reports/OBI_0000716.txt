  label: ChIP-seq assay
  alternative term: chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing assay
  definition: an assay which aims at identifying protein binding sites in genomic DNA and determining how protein may regulate gene transcription by relying on immunoprecipitation of DNA bound protein, creation of a library of corresponding DNA fragments  (either single or paired-end fragments) and subsequent sequencing using parallelized sequencing methods.
  definition source: adapted from Wikipedia
  example of usage: PMID: 19275939
    ChIP-seq: using high-throughput sequencing to discover protein-DNA interactions.

  curator note: made some modification based on the discussion on 2011/4/4 obi dev call, using DNA sequencing instead of union of some specific DNA sequencing processes
