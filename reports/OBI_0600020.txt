  label: histology
  alternative term: histopathology
  definition: the visual examination of cells or tissue (or images of them) with an assessment regarding a quality of the cells or tissue. Parts are: staining, imaging, judgement
  definition source: OBI branch derived
  example of usage: the counting of the number of cells with fluorescent label at their surface to determine the percentage of the population which was activated
  curator note: PRS:20090901: addition of alternative term = histopathology
  curator note: need to incorporate parts\n---\nThis is a very vague term, it should be in the same place as transcriptomics, proteomics metaboloimcs. It is the 'study' of tissues, not the process of studying tissues\n
