  label: RNASE T2 structure mapping assay
  alternative term: single nucleotide resolution mapping assay using RNAse T2
  definition: a single-nucleotide-resolution ribonucleic acid structure mapping assay which uses RNAse T2 as reagent and enzymatic probe to generate data and information at nucleotide resolution scale contributing to the determination of nucleic acid secondary structure
