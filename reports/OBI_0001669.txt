  label: far-Western blot
  definition: is a adaptation on the western blot assay to explore protein-protein interaction. The assay involves separating target proteins on an SDS-PAGE gel, blotting to a membrane, hybridization with a protein probe and visualization using a probe-directed antibody. 
  definition source: adapted from ECO, PMID:18079728
  example of usage: Studying protein-protein interactions via blot overlay or Far Western blot.
