  label: single-nucleotide-resolution nucleic acid structure mapping assay
  definition: is an assay which aims to provide information about the secondary structure of nucleic acids using chemical or enzymatic probing to establish the extent of base-pairing or solvent accessiblity.
  definition source: RNAO
