  label: Edinburgh handedness assay
  definition: The Edinburgh Handedness assay is an assay in which a set of questions  = the Edinburgh Handedness inventory - is asked and the answers to these questions are turned into a score, used to assess the dominance of a person's right or left hand in everyday activities. The inventory can be used by an observer assessing the person, or by a person self-reporting hand use. The latter method tends to be less reliable due to a person over-attributing tasks to the dominant hand.
