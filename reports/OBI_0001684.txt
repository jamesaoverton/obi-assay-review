+ label: methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction
- label: methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction 
  alternative term: MSP
  definition: is an assay which uses initial modification of DNA by sodium bisulfite, converting all unmethylated, but not methylated, cytosines to uracil, and subsequent amplification with primers specific for methylated versus unmethylated DNA.
  definition source: PMID:8790415
  example of usage: Methylation status of breast cancer resistance protein detected by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction analysis is correlated inversely with its expression in drug-resistant lung cancer cells. PMID: 18219662
  editor note: 2015-03-30 OBI dev call:
    The assay was defined as equvivalent to
    (assay and (has_specified_input some 'binding complex 3D structure determination assay') and (has_specified_output some 
    ('data item' and ('is about' some 'regulation of DNA methylation')))) and (achieves_planned_objective some 'epigenetic modification identification objective')
     'binding complex 3D structure determination assay' is a process and cannot be the input of another process which cause inconsistent.
    In the call, we decided to remove axiom and will discuss it in the assay harmonization discussion.
