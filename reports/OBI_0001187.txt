  label: infectious agent detection assay
  definition: An assay in which the presence or amount of an infectious agent in an input material is detected in an evaluant
    
  example of usage: Culturing a sputum sample on agar medium to detect bacterial growth; Stain slices of liver from a mouse to count presence of infectious centers. 
    
  editor note: 2/22/2011, BP: This should probably be an analyte assay, but the logical definition of those is currently restricted to 'scattered molecular aggregates', which excludes using infectious agents as analytes. See below
    (realizes some 
        ('evaluant role'
         and (role_of some material_entity)))
     and (realizes some 
        ('analyte role'
         and (role_of some 'infectious agent')))
     and (achieves_planned_objective some 'analyte measurement objective')
