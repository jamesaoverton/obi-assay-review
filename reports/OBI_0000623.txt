  label: NMR spectroscopy
  alternative term: Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
  definition: NMR spectroscopy is a process which exploits the magnetic properties of certain nuclei (those with a spin) to resonate when placed in particular magnetic field conditions. Instruments recording NMR spectrum and sets of analysis can be used to deduce  identity of chemical as well as composition of complex chemical mixtures.
