  label: sequencing assay
  definition: the use of a chemical or biochemical means to infer the sequence of a biomaterial
  definition source: OBI branch derived
  example of usage: The use of the Sanger method of DNA sequencing to determine the order of the nucleotides in a DNA template
  editor note: has_output should be sequence of input; we don't have sequence well defined yet
  term editor: PlanAndPlannedProcess Branch

  subclass of: assay
+ subclass of: '(has_specified_output some 'sequence data') and (achieves_planned_objective some 'assay objective')'
+ subclass of: (has_specified_input some 'deoxyribonucleic acid' or 'ribonucleic acid' or protein') and (realizes some ('evaluant role' and ('inheres in' some 'deoxyribonucleic acid' or 'ribonucleic acid' or protein')))
+ subclass of: has_specified_input some 'DNA or RNA or protein'
+ subclass of: has_specified_input some 'deoxyribonucleic acid' or 'ribonucleic acid' or protein'
+ subclass of: has_specified_output some 'sequence data'
- equivalent to: (has_specified_output some 'sequence data') and (achieves_planned_objective some 'assay objective')
