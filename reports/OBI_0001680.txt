+ label: Sos-recruitment assay
- label: Sos-recruitment assay 
  alternative term: SRS
  definition: is a kind of yeast 2 hybrid system where mammalian guanyl nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Sos is recruited to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae plasma membrane harboring a temperature-sensitive Ras GEF, Cdc25-2, allowing growth at the nonpermissive temperature. Using the Sos recruitment system, interacting proteins for targeted domain can be detected.
  definition source: adapted from the original publication by Aronheim et al, 1997. PMID: 9154808
+ example of usage: The Sos-recruitment system as a tool to analyze cellular localization of plant proteins: membrane localization of Arabidopsis thaliana PEPINO/PASTICCINO2.
